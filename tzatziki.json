  "title": "Tzatziki",
  "summary": "This recipe uses mint (which means it's Turkish), but you can substitute dill (to make it Greek).  It has quite a bite of raw garlic, so scale back on the number of cloves if you're not into that.",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cucumber",
    "2 cups plain yogurt",
    "4 cloves garlic",
    "1/2 bunch mint",
    "salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cut the cucumber in half and scoop out the seeds.",
    "Grate the cucumber and put it in a strainer.  Sprinkle a little salt over it and mix it in.  Leave it to drain.",
    "Mince the garlic cloves and add them to the yogurt.",
    "Chiffonade the mint leaves -- you're aiming for about a 1/4 of a cup.  Add them to the yogurt.",
    "When the cucumber has drained, squeeze it down to get out as much juice as possible.  Mix the cucumber into the rest of the ingredients."
